                Always on the look out to learn new techniques, I'm a front end developer that is constantly amazed by the depth
                and complexity of web development. What fuels my interest for web development is that there is more than one way
                to solve a problem and the sense of fulfillment when it is fixed. When I'm not learning new things, I like to spend
                my free time keeping fit, playing games, and reading.
